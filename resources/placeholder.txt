This directory is for application resources:

- icon.ico - Windows application icon (48x48 or 256x256 recommended)
- icon.icns - macOS application icon bundle

You can replace these with your own icons before building.

Icon requirements:
- Windows (.ico): 48x48 or 256x256 pixels recommended
- macOS (.icns): Must be an Apple Icon Image format
- Linux: No specific icon needed, will use system theme

Note: The build process will work without icons, they are optional.
